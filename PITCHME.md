### What's BenchmarkDotNet ?

- .NET Library for Microbenchmark / Component benchmark |
- .NET Framework (4.6+), .NET Core (2.0+), Mono, CoreRT |
- C#, F#, VB |
- Windows, Linux, OSX |

---

> Microbenchmarking is about measuring the performance of something "small" 

> It's not about optimization but about solving bottlenecks

### When is it needed ? 

+++
A code section has been identified as problematic in your application

+++
You suspect that some code is more time consuming than it should 

+++
Performance is an issue or feature so you need to make sure of the effect of a specific piece of code / component at runtime

---

### Benchmarking is hard 

+++
Intermediate to expert level on the runtime needed to make sure you measure the right thing.

+++
Failure to isolate properly what needs benchmarking results in useless metrics 

+++
Failure to make sufficient run of what needs benchmarking, makes metrics inacurate

+++
Even if you get all that right, reporting things correctly, is what comes next !

---

### BenchmarkingDotNet helps 

- Gives you a extensive api to create and parameter your benchmark |
- Runs benchmarking operations (including warmup) |
- Calculates statistical data, creates reporting for you |
- Gives you a nice short summary |

---

### Ok cool but what do I do ?

- You set up your code in methods with the correct annotation on the methods and class |
- You might configure your project (csproj / fsproj / vbproj) with necessary targets, if you run a multi-target benchmark |
- You run the project in RELEASE mode and wait for the results |

## Demo

C# vs F#

+++
We implement a simple FizzBuzz 

+++
Then for a Range from 1 to N (included) we apply the FizzBuzz logic, given different implementation in C# and F#.

+++
C# signature of benchmark target

```csharp
string SomeImplementation(Range range); 
```

+++
F# signature of benchmark target]
```fs
val someImplementation : Range -> string[]
```
+++

# Coding Time !

### In short

- BenchmarkDotNet is a highly configurable library for microbenchmark |
- We do microbenchmark in addition of profiling and other performance related skills |
- Already widely used, included but not limited : CoreCLR, Roslyn, EntityFrameworkCore, Orleans, Serilog, Autofac ... |
